# FanPool

FanPool is a creator economy platform that allows fans to pool their crypto holdings for their favorite social media influencer, music artist, or any creator. 

The pooled crypto funds would be parked in a yield generating vehicle(we used Compound), with the yield profits going to the Creator.  The fans would be able to financially contribute to their favorite artists while their original investments remain untouched.  

Whenever the fans want to remove their funds from this pool they can do so. In exchange for this the Creators are suggested by the platform to reward the fans by providing NFT swags.
